## Investigate_TMDb_Movie_Dataset_Udacity_data_analyst_nanodegree
### Introduction
In this project, We have to choose any one Dataset for investigation out of 4. 
I have choosen TMDb Movie Data for my Investigation in this project.

In this project, I have done my own data analysis and created a file to share my findings. 
I will start by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorm what questions I could answer using it. 
Then i will use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions that I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. 
In this project I had to submit HTML and pdf fromat of the project in one compressed zip file.
